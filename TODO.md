# TODO: Add More Styles to Frontend

- [x] Edit client/src/index.css to add global custom styles including animations (e.g., fade-in for messages, typing indicators), improved color schemes, and enhanced UI elements.
- [x] Edit client/src/App.css to add app-specific styles like background gradients and better visual themes.
- [ ] Test the styles by running the development server and verifying the UI improvements.
